	            Record Management System is the generic name I am giving to software I architected and programmed 
	            for my job. This enterprise web application will make it easier for the clients to perform their job duties.
            </p>
            <p>
	            RMS contains many features that make it easy to create, update, edit, and manage records.
	            It has a multi-stage approval system that allows reviewers to approve, reject, or correct records
	            within their scope of authority. It has custom reporting features that allow users to produce PDF and Excel
	            reports of the records. There's even an automatic email notification system that allows users to
	            track the approval process for a record they submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I can't show screenshots of it due to potential privacy issues, but I will try and 
                develop a prototype of a generic record management system as a consolation prize.
