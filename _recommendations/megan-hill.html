    Joseph's combinations of strong technical skills and passion for people management make him an exceptionally strong engineer and leader for any team he is a part of. His attention to detail makes him stand out as an engineer and help him methodically guide his teams to success. He truly cares about the members of his team and is willing to go above and beyond to ensure they are growing.

    I have enjoyed working with Joseph as he is always willing to take the time to thoroughly understand business requirements and explain technical limitations. He is always willing to jump into troubleshooting mode with me and dig into the core of issues (whether technical or people) as they come up.

    Joseph's passion for people management has made him one of my go to people to discuss challenges I'm having as a manager of my own team. He always provides good insights and does a great job helping me to understand the various sides of the issue that I may not be seeing. He is constantly sharing resources with his fellow managers and teams to help them level up within their own roles.

    I would recommend Joseph for any role where he's able to flex his leadership and management skills by influencing engineering team members and overall software development processes.
