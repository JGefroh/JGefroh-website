  Working with Joseph at Snap! Raise can be pretty effectively summed up by one of the company's core tenants: "Continuous Improvement". He embodied and enabled it on every team he worked with.
</p>
<p>
  His dedication to improving people, processes and the quality of codebases are second to none and were core drivers in the engineering team's maturation from early stage MVP-driven startup to industry standard engineering team and stable web/mobile platform. His independence and initiative drove necessary organizational change both inside the engineering organization and the company at large.
</p>
<p>
  One of his greatest demonstrated strengths during my tenure with Joseph is his ability to uplift the people on his team directly through intentional mentorship. Combined with more indirect changes through structure, process and planning, every team Joseph worked with became more technically skilled, comfortable with Agile concepts, and predictable in their work output.
