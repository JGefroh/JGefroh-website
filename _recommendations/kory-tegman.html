  At Snap! Raise I hired Joseph to take over my role as lead our Advance product. He made the most of the opportunity. He picked up on the technology fast and gained the respect of the team quickly as well. He is extremely well organized and has implemented very effective development practices and feature design practices. It is always nice to work with someone who is well versed in their skillset and open about making the team and business better. Sometimes that comes from challenging ideas that are not working well and at the same time making sure people are respected for their hard work.

  All in all Joseph is a great technologist, mentor and team lead. I would recommend him for any position in any of those roles.
