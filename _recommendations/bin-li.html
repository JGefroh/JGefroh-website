  Joseph is one of the best engineers I have ever worked with. He has a clear mind about his career path, and he shows great leadership ability.
</p>
<p>
  He is an engineer with passion and has a big picture view of the projects. I was very impressed by his quick and accurate actions on reviewing project code. He gives consideration to all kinds of factors and knows what the best solution will be.
</p>
<p>
  Joseph is very good at managing projects, efficiently assigning time and resources. He has a good sense about the client requirements and plays a perfect role between clients and the engineering team.

  I liked the time I spent working with Joseph, and I hope I can work with him again. I am looking forward to seeing his success in the future.
