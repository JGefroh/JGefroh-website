<p>I have worked with many programmers, coders and developers in my career and it is my belief that Joseph Gefroh is one of the best I have met. He is methodical, he thinks through and plans his projects with care and detail that ensures that what he builds is scaleable, secure and easy to maintain.</p>
<p>Yet he is more, besides being an excellent software engineer, he is extremely adept at managing a team of engineers. He understands how they think, how to motivate them and how to get the best work out of the team. His guidance and patience results in a content team of programmers who create solid code behind solid systems. We are lucky to have him guiding our development and I am grateful for the opportunity to work with and learn from him!</p>
