<p>
  Joseph is an incredible software manager. He has an intuitive understanding of the balance between business and technological needs and he incorporates that knowledge into our teams at Snap! Raise both by example and instruction.
</p>

<p>
  He meets with most of the development team regularly in one-on-one sessions to ensure we're developing as engineers and learning the skills for success in everyday work as well as the skills that will help us achieve our longer term personal goals.
</p>
<p>
  His passion for adhering to foundational engineering principles is contagious and he's made our team excited about building products that we're proud of.
</p>
<p>
  I recommend Joseph for any position where he's in a position to inspire and lead an engineering team.
