            <p>The Physician License Status Service (PLSS) is a team project I worked
            on as primary programmer/secondary project manager for a project management
            course. It was a part of the State of Hawaii's health transformation
            initiative, and intention was to create an API to facilitate the 
            rapid transfer of information amongst physicians, insurers, and other 
            interested third parties. It is effectively an API adapter that third parties
            can use to access a state database of license holders and do batch
            checks to see if licenses are in good standing or not.</p>
            
            <p>
            The PLSS API was intended to improve information exchange amongst
            care providers by decreasing the amount of time required before
            the status of a licensee could be verified. When a doctor requests
            patient information to provide care for a patient, he or she would
            not need to wait as long to receive this information because their
            license status could be verified by the holder of the information, 
            and not through a chain of third parties and state agencies.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We developed the proof-of-concept and a fully functional prototype
            in Python 3, along with proper documentation and test cases.
            The API allowed for single and batch license searches using license 
            IDs, names, and license ranges, and returned results in proper XML
            format. It worked fairly well but, due to a lack of
            database access, relied on the web interface of an existing website
            that actively prevented frequent requests using captchas.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Additionally, we developed a huge amount of documentation in the course of project management, including
            charters, evaluation and status reports, plans, work breakdown structures, schedules, responsibility
            matrices, stakeholder and risk analysis, etc.
            </p>

            Unfortunately, the project was terminated due to several factors, including time and
            direction (Database/Web API). Besides that, the project went well. We met all
            of our milestones up until it was cancelled and had a final result 
            that was functional and worked correctly. Further development could
            easily lead to it becoming a long-term solution for the State and 
            stakeholders.
