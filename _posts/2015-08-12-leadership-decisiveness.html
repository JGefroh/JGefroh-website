  <p>How many times has this conversation taken place between two people:</p>
  <p>
    "Where do you want to eat?" <br/>
    "I don't know, where do YOU want to eat?" <br/>
    "I don't know, what are you in the mood for?" <br/>
    "I don't know, I can go for anything." <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    This might go back and forth a few times. If they're lucky, they'll end up eating at a place they both enjoy before they starve to death.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now imagine the same question posed to a group of people. Someone will suggest a place. Another will disagree. Someone will call a vote. Another will say a vote won't work because everyone needs to agree. Time is wasted. People get hungry. Some even get hangry. The group splits up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Welcome to a world where people can't decide.
  </p>
  <p>
    An important aspect of leadership is being able to make a timely decision, whether good or bad, right or wrong. A lot of people can't make decisions because they become caught up with the unattainable dream of making the "best" decision. They're afraid of the consequences of making a bad decision, or by missing out on a better outcome, so they spend far too much time weighing the options.
  </p>
  <p>
    While it's true that due diligence should be done before making a decision, it's also important to realize that in most cases a decision doesn't have to be perfect - it just has to be good enough. If the available options are relatively equal in value, the cost of weighing the options can easily overshadow the benefits of picking the best option. Worse yet, the window of opportunity can slam shut before a decision can be made - maybe your competitors will buy out that company first, forcing you to scramble and react to their sudden increase in market share instead of controlling the situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a situation where the cost of weighing the options increases with every passing moment, such as during an emergency, making a decision in a timely manner becomes critical to success. If you were trapped in a burning building, you wouldn't want the firemen to stand around for 30 minutes wondering if they should break down the door or go through the window to save you - you want them to act immediately and with decisiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's why I like to say "If you don't make a decision, a decision will be made for you." It's the responsibility of the leader to ensure that a good-enough decision is made in a timely manner. Remember: <i>the worst decision you can make is indecision</i>.
