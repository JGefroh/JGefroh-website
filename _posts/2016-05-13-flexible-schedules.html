  <blockquote><i>An autonomous developer is a happy developer, and a happy developer is a productive developer.</i></blockquote>

  <p>At HNL.IO, we've fully embraced that idea by ensuring that the team has complete control over their own schedules.
    They can choose when they want to work and how long they want to work. There's no tracking or monitoring of their comings and goings.
    If they want to take a day off in the middle of the week to go to the beach, there's nothing stopping them but the weather.

    A typical corporate manager would look at that in absolute horror.
    Won't developers just abuse that freedom by doing on the most minimal work? Surprisingly, no!
  </p>

  <p>
    Most developers want to do a good job. They want to create amazing, useful products and be productive.
    Keeping a developer chained to a desk from 9-5 is counter-productive because it makes high-performing employees lose motivation.
    Those employees know the times when they are most productive, and more often than not they choose to work during those times.
    Forcing them to work when they are least productive, or giving them busy-work if there's nothing to do, can lead to decreased quality
    and output as it affects the rest of their work. It's better to trust them and judge the results they produce instead of trying to
    micromanage the effort they put in.

    This requires a high degree of trust and skilled developers. Part of the hiring process is to ensure we only hire
    developers who exhibit traits like initiative and follow-through. There absolutely are people who will abuse it,
    but those people should be discovered quickly by an effective team manager.
