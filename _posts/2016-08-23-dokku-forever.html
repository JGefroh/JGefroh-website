title: Dokku Forever
blurb: I just couldn't stay away from dokku's container API.

<p>
  I've completely started from scratch with my dokku deployment. I just couldn't stay away from dokku's ease of setup and use.
  It's so simple to deploy applications built on completely different techstacks with a single <code>git push</code>. The consistent API
  to set configuration variables, link containers, and set URLs helps turn once arduous deployments into no-brainers.

  I found out what my issue was - along with some de-activated containers, the vast majority of my disk space was taken by the many logs from my applications. Looking around,
  I saw a couple 5gb log files - pretty huge especially considering the server only has 20 gigabytes. The simplest solution was to automatically trim all the log files via <code>truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log</code>.

  It's not the prettiest, but it works. As these projects are personal projects, I don't need the log files.

  This entire experience has led me to focus a bit of my learning efforts on server monitoring.
  I've created an application, <a href="http://sysiphus.jgefroh.com">Sysiphus</a> to help me keep track of resource usage and monitor uptime
  of my applications. It's been a lot of fun working on it so far, and I can't wait to see what features I can add to it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jgefroh/sysiphus">open source</a>,
  so feel free to comment on the code!
