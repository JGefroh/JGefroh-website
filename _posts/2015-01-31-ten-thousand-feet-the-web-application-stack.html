<div>
    <p>It's important that everyone involved in a software project understands how it is structured.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>
        Junior developers should understand what piece they are working on and how their module fits into the rest of the application.
        With this knowledge, they can report interface/implementation problems early on as well as make better decisions regarding the
        implementation so that their decisions are aligned with the spirit of the rest of the application.
    </p>

    <p>Project managers and business analysts should also understand the architecture.
       They can use it to identify what might get in the way of the solution being built and
       work on removing those obstacles early on so that success is more likely. They can also manage the expectations
       of the client so that they understand what is and isn't possible. By doing this, they can see how the project fits
       into the overall strategy of the organization and provide thought leadership on what next steps to take.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <h4>The Stack</h4>
    <p>
        Today's modern web applications are generally structured as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Front-end</strong>: the user interface - what the users see, interact with, and comment on the most.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Services</strong>: the entrance to the server side for the front-end and potentially other applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Logic</strong>: the business rules that govern the application's operations are stored here.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Access</strong>: provides a unified interface to access the data regardless of where it is held.</li>
        <li><strong>Dat Storage</strong>: the place your data is stored.</li>

      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        One key thing to note is that knowledge of other layers is unidirectional. The layers below should not know about the layers above. This allows layers
        to be changed and even swapped out entirely without affecting the other parts of the stack. For example, the front-end can be completely rewritten from
        a JQuery front-end to an AngularJS front-end without affecting any other part of the application. Data Storage can change from a file system
        to a database and only the data access layer would need to change.
    </p>

    <div>
        <h3>Front-End</h3>
        <p>
        The front-end, or the user interface, is what the user interacts with when using the application.
        All of the buttons they click, the fields they type into, and the data they see is visible on the front-end.
        </p>
        <label>Types</label>
        <p>
            Two types of front-ends have emerged in the web application space: server side controlled and single page applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Server-side controlled front-ends are processed on the server first before being delivered to the user's web browser. Technologies like PHP and Java Server Pages are used
            to create what the user sees on the server prior to sending it to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Single Page Applications, on the other hand, do their processing on the user's computer instead, allowing for richer, real-time interactions that feel faster.
            Most of these applications use Javascript or Javascript related frameworks/libraries like JQuery and AngularJS to perform this processing.
        </p>
        <label>Making Great Applications</label>
        <p>
            Figuring out how a page looks, what it shows, and examining the interactions the user can have with it are important to provide a usable, useful, valuable application for users.
            It's the job of the User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) expert to figure out how to make it easy for users to accomplish their goals in the application.
            This should not be taken lightly - if users cannot accomplish their goals, the application is a failure.
        </p>
        <label>A final note</label>
        <p>
            One important security consideration is that the front-end is not a trusted source. Data sent from the front-end should be verified by the server before being used.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Web Services</h3>
        <p>
            The Web Service is the communication gateway into your server side. Your application's front-end will use the web service to perform actions and manipulate data.
        </p>

        <label>Types of Web Services</label>
        <p>There are two main types of Web Services: SOAP and REST.
        <p>
            SOAP is an older type of web service that uses a markup syntax called XML to define the way requests and responses are structured.
        </p>
        <p>
            REST is a newer type of web service that uses the HTTP protocol to perform requests and actions. Data sent to and from REST web services is typically in a format called JSON.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use REST unless you have a very specific reason to use SOAP (such as supporting legacy software that already uses it).
        </p>

        <label>Web Services as a Service</label>
        <p>
            Web Services can be used by multiple applications communicate with a server, or with each other.
            They can be used to provide or consume services independent of other applications.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Business Logic</h3>
        <p>
            The business logic layer houses the reason your application exists - to perform business operations based on specific organizational rules.
        </p>

        <label>Why the separation?</label>
        <p>
            The reason the business logic is kept in a distinct layer is because of the design principle to "encapsulate changes".
            Business logic changes frequently, and good application structure ensures that there is a singular place that houses the business
            logic for any given domain object. If business logic were allowed to be in any of the other layers, it would be difficult
            to figure out where changes had to be made and how they would affect the rest of the system.
        <p>

        <label>Web Services as a Service</label>
        <p>
            Web Services can be used by multiple applications communicate with a server, or with each other.
            They can be used to provide or consume services independent of other applications.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Data Access</h3>
        <p>
            Tbe Data Access layer provides a consistent interface that allows your application to retrieve and manipulate data.
        </p>

        <label>Why the separation?</label>
        <p>
            Data access is in its own layer because the rest of the application shouldn't be concerned with where and how the data is stored. This way, logic to  the data isn't
            mixed in with business logic, and if a data source changes, the entire application doesn't need to change - only the data access layer does.
        </p>
        <p>
            By having data access separate, an application can actually use multiple data sources, such as a database and a mainframe system, to
            manipulate data without any other part of the application knowing.
        <p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
        <p>
            The data storage layer houses the data and allows it to be stored, retrieved, and used by the application.
        </p>

        <p>
            Data Storage in a modern web application is typically a database like Oracle, DB2, or MySQL, but not always.
            Legacy systems that were modernized can easily have a mainframe or legacy storage device as its data storage layer.
            Other data storage strategies might involve keeping the data in memory or on the file system.
