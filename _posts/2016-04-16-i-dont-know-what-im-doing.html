    As the co-owner and team lead at hnl.io, I have a lot of responsibilities.
    <ul>
      <li>Lead the team in developing the platform.</li>
      <li>Mentor teammates and ensure they are happy, motivated, productive, and growing professionally.</li>
      <li>Manage product direction.</li>
      <li>Find and pursue opportunities for outreach and strategic relationships.</li>
      <li>Figure out company direction.</li>
      <li>Brand and market the platform.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll be completely honest: I have zero qualifications to do most of these things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leading teams in developing software is my specialty,
    but I don't know the first thing when it comes to pursuing outreach opportunities or branding and performing market research.
    Most of this is new territory for me, and it has become a sink or swim situation with little to no guidance.
    Oftentimes I'll go home after a long day at work and think to myself "<i>What the heck am I doing?</i>".

  <p>
    Unlike programming, a lot of these responsiblities don't have clear goals or realistically measurable results given our resources and capabilities. It's a rare moment when I can come out of a meeting and say with certainty
    "<i>this meeting helped us get 20 sign-ups today</i>" or "<i>this meeting just brought in $5000 for the company</i>."

  <p>
    Yet, here I am, trying trying to figure out if a pivot in another direction will be more beneficial than staying the course, or whether we should talk to this company instead of this one. It feels like the blind leading the blind.

    Strangely enough, though, we're making progress. Little by little, I see success. People we've never previously met have heard of the platform.
    Our view count has risen drastically. There's more and more content on the platform with less and less involvement from us.
    Our company received a sponsorship (thanks HTDC)!

    Imagine driving down a winding road at night. The darkness prevents you from seeing more than the few measly meters illuminated by the car's headlights.
    Shadows dance all around you, trees come out of nowhere and disappear as quickly as they pop into view.
    Even though you can't see the rest of the road, you don't crash.
    Despite the lack of information, despite all of the unexpected twists and turns, you keep driving confidently because you can see the next immediate step.

    You still make progress, and eventually you reach your destination.

    This job is like that. I don't know the exact path to success. I can't tell if what we're doing is working. I can only see a few steps ahead. Despite that, we're steadily making progress towards our goals.

    Some people seem to have all the answers. Some people know exactly what they are doing and where they are going. I'm not one of them.
    I don't know what I'm doing...but that's okay.
