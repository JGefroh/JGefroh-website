<h3>Avoid Comments that Say What - Use Methods Instead</h3>
<p>Some developers like to add comments outlining WHAT the code is doing:</p>
<pre>
private void play() {
    //print greeting
    String playerName = "Joseph";
    String opponentName = "Bill the Computer";
    System.out.println("Hello " + playerName + " I am " + opponentName);
    System.out.println("Let's play a number game.");

    while (true) {
        //print input prompt
        System.out.print("Please guess a number (max is 5):" );

        //get guess
        Random number = new Random();
        int number2 = number.nextInt(5);
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
        int guess = reader.nextInt();

        //print results
        if (guess == -1) { //quit
            System.out.println("buhbye");
            break;
        }
        else if (number2 == guess) { //winning
            System.out.println("You guessed " + guess + " and I was thinking of " + number2);
            System.out.println(meep + " you won!");
        }
        else if (number2 != guess) { //losing
            System.out.println("You guessed " + guess + " and I was thinking of " + number2);
            System.out.println("You lost loser");
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>On the surface it seems easy to understand the code just by reading the comments. However, there are several pitfalls.<p>
<p>One is that code changes. A comment that is accurate today may not be accurate tomorrow. It's an additional maintenance burden to make sure the comments are up to date and accurate.</p>
<p>Second is that there is no guarantee that comments can be trusted. The 'get guess' comment in the example above is lying - it's also generating the random number that will be the answer.</p>

<br/>
<p>It would be easier to understand if these comments were turned into methods with well thought-out names:</p>
<pre>
        private void play() {
          printGreeting();
          while (true) {
            printInputPrompt();
            int guessedNumber = getUserGuess();
            if (isQuitRequested(guessedNumber)) {
                printGoodbye();
                break;
            }
            int generatedNumber = generateRandomNumber();
            printResults(playerName, guessedNumber, generatedNumber);
        }
    </pre>
<p>Not only is it easier to understand WHAT the program is doing, it isolates you from having to deal with HOW the program is doing it.</p>
<p>It also has the advantage of providing guarantees of when and where a step starts and ends. Because all of the fields and values used by a method are tightly encapsulated in it, you have a gurantee that they won't bleed over into unrelated steps.</p>
<br/>
<p>
    There's definitely the possibility that the method names are lying. However, if a method doesn't produce the right result, you've narrowed it down and can ignore the unrelated methods.
    With the commented code, there can be a bug in the method, and you would have no way to knowing where it was introduced without tracing it.
</p>
<p>
    Maintenance-wise, method names can also go out of date, but I find that this rarely happens.
    When a method starts doing something it shouldn't, programmers catch it fairly quickly because a method that lies to them is a lot more serious and detectable than a comment that lies.
</p>
<p>
    Some people complain the code becomes longer as a result, but it is only by a few lines per method - well worth the ease of understanding.
</p>
<p>
    The only unanswered criticism I know of is that using methods makes you have to jump around a lot in the code.
