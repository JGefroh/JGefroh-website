    <p>It's important that everyone involved in a software project understands how it is structured.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>
        Junior developers should understand what piece they are working on and how their module fits into the rest of the application.
        With this knowledge, they can report interface/implementation problems early on as well as make better decisions regarding the
        implementation so that their decisions are aligned with the spirit of the rest of the application.
    </p>

    <p>Project managers and business analysts should also understand the architecture.
       They can use it to identify what might get in the way of the solution being built and
       work on removing those obstacles early on so that success is more likely. They can also manage the expectations
       of the client so that they understand what is and isn't possible. By doing this, they can see how the project fits
       into the overall strategy of the organization and provide thought leadership on what next steps to take.

    <h4>The Stack</h4>
    <p>
        Today's modern web applications are generally structured as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <div data-ng-include data-src="'modules/blog/posts/2015-31-01-ten-thousand-feet-the-web-application-stack/the-stack.html'"></div>
        </div>
    </div>


    <p>
        One key thing to note is that knowledge of other layers is unidirectional. The layers below should not know about the layers above. This allows layers
        to be changed and even swapped out entirely without affecting the other parts of the stack. For example, the front-end can be completely rewritten from
        a JQuery front-end to an AngularJS front-end without affecting any other part of the application. Data Storage can change from a file system
        to a database and only the data access layer would need to change.
