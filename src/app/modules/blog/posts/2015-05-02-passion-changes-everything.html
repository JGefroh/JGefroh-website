        The best software developers I’ve encountered are those that love what they do. They have a passion for their craft.
        I don’t mean that they abandon their social life for programming, or that they are the best at what they do.
        I mean that they have a noticeable zest, an indescribable gung-ho, can-do, will-do attitude that keeps them hungry and striving to become better.

        A passionate developer will go out of their way to find creative solutions to pressing problems, instead of taking the easy way out.
        Passionate developers embrace change and use it to improve themselves, their teams, and their processes.
        You can rely on a passionate developer to get the job done because they’ll accept nothing less than the best they can give.

        Unfortunately, not everyone is a passionate developer. Some people simply don’t care or deceive themselves into thinking they don’t need to improve.
        They push back against change as if becoming better was a bad thing. It’s <span style="font-style:italic;">disgusting</span> to see people do the bare minimum,
        especially when you know they are capable of so much more. Even an imperfect effort is a thousand times better
        than not putting in any effort at all. Passionless developers that accept mediocrity and the status quo end up stagnating,
        and they won’t even notice they’ve been left behind until it is too late.

        I don’t want to see that happen to anyone, so I end up lighting fires under people so that they strive to do more.
        I push them to be better than they were the day before. I try to give them the tools, techniques, and direction they need to improve themselves.
        Some people rise to the challenge, find their passion, and make tremendous gains. They start to seek out new knowledge and skills on their own, and apply them to become better.
        Their passion starts to feed your passion, and it spreads like a wildfire.
        It changes everyone and everything: the team, the development environment, the quality of software, and even the organization.

        These are the developers I want to work with.
