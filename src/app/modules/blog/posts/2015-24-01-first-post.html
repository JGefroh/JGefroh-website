    <p>This is going to be the first of many blog posts on this website. I'm hoping I can write down my development thoughts here so I can look back in the future and see where I was right and where I was dead wrong.</p>
    <br/>

    <h4>Another Attempt</h4>
    <p>My previous attempts at technical blogging using Wordpress and Jekyll have failed. I got so focused on the appearance and trying to make a cool looking blog that I never got around to actually writing posts.</p>
    <p>This blog is different though - I'm not focused on making it pretty and I don't have to work with a whole CMS interface - just a plain .html file and a simple .json post registry.</p>
    <br/>

    <h4>The Idea</h4>
    <p>The blog is incredibly simple, and works in a two step process.</p>
    <p>When the page first loads, it checks the URL after the <code>#/blog/posts/</code> and loads the blog post if it is present.</p>
    <p>To generate the post listing, I load a <code>.json</code> file that contains the list of posts that is shown to the user. When you click on a post heading, it re-requests the page with the new URL, starting the cycle over again.</p>
