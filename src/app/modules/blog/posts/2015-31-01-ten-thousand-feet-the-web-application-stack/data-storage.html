    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
        The data storage layer houses the data and allows it to be stored, retrieved, and used by the application.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data Storage in a modern web application is typically a database like Oracle, DB2, or MySQL, but not always.
        Legacy systems that were modernized can easily have a mainframe or legacy storage device as its data storage layer.
        Other data storage strategies might involve keeping the data in memory or on the file system.
