    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
        The data storage layer houses the data and allows it to be stored, retrieved, and used by the application.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data Storage in a modern web application is typically a database like Oracle, DB2, or MySQL, but not always.
        Legacy systems that were modernized can easily have a mainframe or legacy storage device as its data storage layer.
        Other data storage strategies might involve keeping the data in memory or on the file system.
    </p>
    <p>
        By having data access separate, an application can actually use multiple data sources, such as a database and a mainframe system, to
        manipulate data without any other part of the application knowing. The logic of accessing these different sources would be completely hidden
        to the rest of the application, which makes maintenance significantly easier.
