    <h3>Business Logic</h3>
    <p>
        The business logic layer houses the reason your application exists - to perform business operations based on specific organizational rules.
    </p>

    <label>Why the separation?</label>
    <p>
        The reason the business logic is kept in a distinct layer is because of the design principle to "encapsulate changes".
        Business logic changes frequently, and good application structure ensures that there is a singular place that houses the business
        logic for any given domain object. If business logic were allowed to be in any of the other layers, it would be difficult
        to figure out where changes had to be made and how they would affect the rest of the system.
