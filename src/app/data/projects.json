It is effectively an API adapter that third parties can use to access a state database of license holders and do batch checks to see if licenses are in good standing or not.",

When a doctor requests patient information to provide care for a patient, he or she would not need to wait as long to receive this information because their license status could be verified by the holder of the information, and not through a chain of third parties and state agencies. ",
                "We developed the proof-of-concept and a fully functional prototype in Python 3, along with proper documentation and test cases. The API allowed for single and batch license searches using license IDs, names, and license ranges, and returned results in proper XML format. It worked fairly well but, due to a lack of database access, relied on the web interface of an existing website that actively prevented frequent requests using captchas.",

Further development could easily lead to it becoming a long-term solution for the State and stakeholders."
