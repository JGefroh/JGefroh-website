			<h1>Shellshock</h1>
			<h2>Status: Actively being developed</h2>
			<p><a class="external" href="https://github.com/JGefroh/Shellshock">Source</a></p>
			
			<p>Shellshock is a 2D side-scrolling shooter that I am developing
			using Java and LWJGL as a pet-project. I'm using it as an opportunity
			to learn the nuances of game development and hopefully I'll have
			a great result at the end of it all!</p>
			
			<p>I'm designing and developing almost everything from the ground up,
			including input, core systems, rendering, audio, etc. After a lot
			of reading, I've decided to develop the game using something called
			a "component-based entity system" which scraps traditional object
			oriented hierarchies in favor of composition, which defines entities
			through their component makeup.</p>
			
			<p>There is still a long ways to go, but adding features so far has
			been very easy thanks to the composition aspect of it. For example,
			to add Movement to the game I needed a position and a velocity.
			With the component system, all I had to do was create a position
			component that held (x,y) coordinates, and a velocity component
			that held velocities for (x,y). I registered the two with an
			entity and created a Movement system to manipulate them using an
			intermediary class that acted as an API for the two components.
