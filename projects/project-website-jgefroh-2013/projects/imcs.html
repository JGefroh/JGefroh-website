			<p>IMCS was an instant messaging client and server that I
			wrote as a class project for three separate classes: 
			Data Communications, Python, and Modern Programming Practices. Don't
			worry, I had permission!</p>
			
			<p>It uses Python's socket interface to send packets via TCP. The
			information was pure text with a specific command or tag at the
			beginning. The tag determined how the message would be processed
			by the server. For example, if I typed in "/MSG Hello everyone", 
			the server would process the message as something to be displayed 
			to other users. If I typed in "/NICK Hello everyone", the server
			would change my displayed nickname to "Hello" and use the password
			"everyone" as verification.</p>
			
			<p>
			Developing this application was a great learning experience. Each
			challenge that was overcome posed even more challenges. Development showed that
			Python's TCP sockets were unable to determine when a new
			message had arrived and what was part of the old message, thanks to
			TCP's non-guaranteed arrival order for packets. To resolve this,
			message sizes were added to the protocol. Other issues appeared, such
			as blocking sockets preventing new connections (resolved with
			threading and welcome sockets), console output overlapping input lines
			(resolved with back/forward ASCII codes), memory leaks (resolved with
			disconnect handlers), and concurrent modification of shared memory
			(resolved via synchronization, locks, and copies).
			</p>
			
			<p>The end result was a cool program and a lot of knowledge gained!</p>
