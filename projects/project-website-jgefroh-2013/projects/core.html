			<h2>Status: Actively being developed.</h2>
				
			<p><a class="external" href="https://github.com/JGefroh/core">Source</a></p>
			
			<p>Core is a framework I am developing to assist me in making games.
			It is a "component-based" entity system, which scraps traditional 
			object oriented hierarchies in favor of composition, which defines 
			entities through their component makeup.
			</p>
			
			<p>These components are accessed and their data manipulated by
			a sequence of systems during the game loop. Core is at the center
			of this and acts as the mediator and controller powering these systems
			and exchanges.</p>
			
			<p>There is still a long ways to go and there are many refinements to make,
			but I've enjoyed working on the framework. It has been a great 
			learning experience!
