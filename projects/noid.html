			<p>NoID is a program that was born out of a business need at
			the university where I used to work. Students were coming into the
			computer center without their IDs and we had to limit their access
			when they reached a certain number of "no ID" entries. Our old
			method was to confirm they were a student, write their information 
			down, and check a spreadsheet file and see how many times they entered.
			We then had to log their information in the spreadsheet, which 
			included their name, id number, the date and time of day, and the 
			number of entries. This	was terribly inefficient and would prevent 
			us from helping others or answering helpdesk calls during busy times.
			</p>
			
			<p>NoID allowed us to rapidly see if the student had previously
			entered the computer center without their ID. It automatically tracked
			the date and time so that all we had to do was press a button to 
			increment the number of times they entered. The program also allowed
			us to search by name, id number, and number of entries. NoID
			significantly decreased the amount of time we wasted tracking the 
			information. What used to take a couple of minutes now took less
			than half a minute!
			</p>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, department policies and other decisions prevented
			NoID's deployment. It eventually became obsolete when we stopped
			bothering to track the students due to the significant amount of
			time it took, despite university policies. Oh, well!
