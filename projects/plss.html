			<h1>PLSS - Physician License Status Service</h1>
			<h2>Status: Terminated</h2>
			
			<p>The Physician License Status Service (PLSS) is a team project I worked
			on as primary programmer for a project management
			course. It was a part of the State of Hawaii's health transformation
			initiative, and intention was to create an API to facilitate the 
			rapid transfer of information amongst physicians, insurers, and other 
			interested third parties. It is effectively an API adapter that third parties
			can use to access a state database of license holders and do batch
			checks to see if licenses are in good standing or not. The
			PLSS API was intended to improve information exchange amongst
			care providers by decreasing the amount of time required before
			the status of a licensee could be verified. When a doctor requests
			patient information to provide care for a patient, he or she would
			not need to wait as long to receive this information because their
			license status could be verified by the holder of the information, 
			and not	through a chain of third parties and state agencies.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			We developed the proof-of-concept and a fully functional prototype
			in Python 3, along with proper documentation and test cases.
			The API allowed for single and batch license searches using license 
			IDs, names, and license ranges, and returned results in proper XML
			format. It worked fairly well but, due to a lack of
			database access, relied on the web interface of an existing website
			that actively prevented frequent requests using captchas.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The project was terminated due to several factors, including time and
			direction (Database/Web API). The project went well, though. We met all
			of our milestones up until it was cancelled and had a final result 
			that was functional and worked correctly. Further development could
			easily lead to it becoming a long-term solution for the State and 
			stakeholders.
