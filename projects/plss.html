			<h1>PLSS - Physician License Status Service</h1>
			<h2>Status: Actively being developed</h2>
			
			<p>The Physician License Status Service (PLSS) is a team project I
			am working on as primary programmer for a project management
			course. It is a part of the State of Hawaii's health transformation
			initiative, and the end result will facilitate the rapid transfer
			of information amongst physicians, insurers, and other interested
			third parties. It is effectively an API adapter that third parties
			can use to access a state database of license holders and do batch
			checks to see if licenses are in good standing or not. Making this
			PLSS API will result in improved information exchange amongst
			care providers by decreasing the amount of time required before
			the status of a licensee can be verified. When a doctor requests
			patient information to provide care for a patient, he or she would
			not need to wait as long to receive this information because their
			license status could be verified by the holder of the information, 
			and not	through a chain of third parties and state agencies.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Our initial prototypes are being developed in Python. Output is
			required to be in XML format, and the API must provide ways for
			batch license validation and license validation via name. Progress
			is going very smoothly, and most of the effort is going into
			producing project management documentation.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I'm not sure if I am allowed to post the source after the project
			is completed, but if I am, I will throw it up on Github.
