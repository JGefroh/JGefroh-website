        Last Stand is an arcade game where you weave, fly, and manuever your spaceship through hundreds of missiles and plasma shots as you fight a variety of deadly enemies!
        Spend points on upgrades like health and shield energy to keep you alive!

      <p>I was the sole developer on the project. I built every system, including rendering, enemy AI, and input handling.</p>

      <p>
        Straight out of college I started developing a simulation framework Core, as a personal endeavor to learn how to make video games.
        I had no prior game develoment experience, but I wanted to learn how to make them the hard way. I built a space invaders clone, Void Attackers, as a proof-of-concept of Core's capabilities and was ready to build a much more complex game.

      <p>
        I was able to take a lot of the existing systems out of my previous game and improve on them. The rendering, texture loading, and input systems were pretty much drop-in and configure.

        I added more complex interactions, such as AI, projectiles with different behavior, and even different kinds of enemies. I added enemy generation, health-bars, and other UI components.
