<p>
  Weave, fly, and manuever your spaceship through hundreds of missiles and plasma shots as you fight a variety of deadly enemies!
  Spend points on upgrades like health and shield energy to keep you alive!
  <br/><br/>Last Stand was built as a proof-of-concept of my simulation framework's capabilities (Core). Everything was <span class="highlight">developed</span> by myself <span class="highlight">from scratch</span> - including rendering, input handling, timing, enemy AI, etc.
