<p>
  A code generator that generates an end-to-end Java EE backend and AngularJS front-end from a given domain model.
</p>
<p>
  HOG is currently able to generate a full REST endpoint, a manager layer with CRUD operations, a DAO layer, and a properly annotated JPA Entity based on the patterns used at my old job.
</p>

<p>
  Included with HOG is PIG, the Practical Interface Generator. PIG is currently able to generate a barebones AngularJS 1.2 interface that allows for CRUD operations and is compatible with code generated by HOG.
</p>

<p>
  I initially built HOG to practice a different coding style where everything was strongly typed and no primitives were passed. I refactored to a simpler style because there was a lot of overhead without much benefit in the original style.
