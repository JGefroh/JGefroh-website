  NoID allowed users to rapidly see if a student had previously entered a computer center without their ID.

<p>
  NoID is a program that was born out of a business need at the university helpdesk where I used to work.
  Students were coming into the computer center without their IDs and we had to limit their access when they reached a certain number of "no ID" entries.
  Our old method was a terribly inefficient process that involved several sheets of paper and an excel spreadsheet, and was easily interrupted by incoming calls to the helpdesk or students requesting assistance.
</p>
<p>
  NoID automatically tracked the date and time of entries, and allowed us to search by a number of fields. NoID significantly decreased the amount of time we wasted tracking students. What used to take a couple of minutes now took less than half a minute!
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, department policies and other decisions prevented NoID's deployment. It eventually became obsolete when we stopped bothering to track the students due to the significant amount of time it took, despite university policies. Oh, well!

  Note: NoID contains some of the worst code I've ever written. View the source with great caution.
