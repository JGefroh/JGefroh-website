  A simple-to-use marker / whiteboard drawing application with redo / undo functionality!
</p>
<p>
  I had been using the Mac as my primary machine for about a year now, and the one thing I missed the most from Windows was the Paint tool. It was super simple to use, and the Mac unfortunately doesn't really have any lightweight alternatives to it.
</p>

  <p>
    I initially built Palette to act as a replacement for the Windows tool, Paint. Initial versions had a plethora of tools, including stamps, shapes drawers, and region selection / manipulation.
    However, as I built it, I realized the usability just wasn't there, and I was over-complicating things.
  </p>

  <p>I pivoted and decided on just simplifying it to the feature I wanted the most: a simple drawing tool.
