testimonial: <span class="highlight">ToDoList is amazing!</span> I've tried more than my share of productivity apps, but nothing comes close to this one. I use, and have come to rely on this app, every day!

  Never miss a responsibility again! ToDoList features trusted to-do-list functionality as well as task scheduling, planning, and time tracking capabilities. Because of the organizational power of its tag system, ToDoList is flexible enough to support users who need to do anything from tracking their grocery list to creating software feature release plans.
  <br/><br/>I developed this by myself entirely from scratch to more efficiently track billable hours.
