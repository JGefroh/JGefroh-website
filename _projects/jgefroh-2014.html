  This was what was website looked like in 2014. I had shown my original website to some of my friends, and they claimed it looked "Windows XP old." It was time to bring my website to the modern age.
</p>
<p>
  After sitting down and thinking about it, I came up with the following list of requirements:
<ul>
  <li>A gallery for my projects</li>
  <li>A modern appearance</li>
  <li>A place to put my resume and skills</li>
  <li>Easily updated with content</li>
  <li>Simple and minimal</li>
  <li>Rapid page loading times</li>
  <li>Compatible with many browsers and window sizes.</li>
  <li>A modern appearance was easy enough. Everyone was using Bootstrap, so I figured I should learn how to use it as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The difficult part would have been the "easily updated" requirement. Footers and navigation bars appear on every page, and would have had to be changed manually. At the time, I decided to use a templating system called Jekyll, which allowed me to split my website into multiple parts and combine them in layouts with a compiler.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, my attempts to make things easier to maintain failed because I focused on the wrong thing. I tried making layouts, footers, and headers easy to change, but the most frequent changes involved actual content. The process of maintaining the website using Jekyll felt heavyweight, and, as a result, I didn't update it frequently.
