<p>
  A real-time framework usable for simulations or games, based off of a component - entity architecture.
</p>
<p>
  I designed and developed Core to assist me in making games. At the time I didn't know
  what kind of game I wanted to make, and traditional object-oriented approaches were architecturally too rigid <tbody>
  respond to quickly changing requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Core's dynamic composition design allowed me to quickly change my code to match the speed at which my ideas changed.
