<p>
  A 2d arcade game modeled after Space Invaders.
</p>
<p>
  I made this game in parallel with my other project, Core. This game was initially intended to demonstrate rendering code and collision checking, but eventually turned into a full blown implementation of Space Invaders.
</p>
<p>
  It showed me exactly how a game would be implemented using my framework, which was a great learning experience. The program itself is not very polished, but at least I don't have to spend quarters to play Space Invaders anymore!
