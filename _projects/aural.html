<p>
  Aural is an ambient noise generator inspired by A Soft Murmur. It allows you to play sounds and adjust the volumes of various background noises to mimic the environment they want to be in.
</p>
<p>
  A study from the University of Chicago discovered that appropriate ambient noise improved productivity and concentration. This has led to the increased popularity of generators like Aural, Coffitivity, and Noisli. Aural does have some soothing sounds, but it also has harsher noises, making it more appropriate as an experience simulator rather than as a relaxation or productivity aide.

<p>I designed and developed Aural.</p>
