<p>
  RMS was a quick prototype that tested several approaches to the development of a record management system. It used Bootstrap and GWT to create a sleek (but rather plain) interface so that various approaches in architecting validation and UI/UX could be tried. I really like the way it turned out, and the prototype gave me good ideas on how to approach development of other modules.

  I used the lessons I learned in the prototype for an unrelated record management system I was developing at my job that also used GWT.
