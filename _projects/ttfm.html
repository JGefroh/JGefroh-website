  To the Farmer's Market (renamed to "Fresh Food HI") is a mobile-friendly web application allows Hawaii's shoppers to locate nearby farmer's markets by date and area.
  Previously, finding a farmer's market was a painstakingly long process of parsing through multiple unconsoldiated sources,
  much of it inaccurate as sources were often out of date by multiple years.
</p>
<p>
  The application also contained an easy-to-use admin interface, allowing market organizers to update their listing quickly without having to
  using the 3rd-party data upload services that they were using previously. The application also had an import feature that
  gave it the capability to pull from federal and state data sources.

<p>
  TTFM was built as part of the 2016 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge.
  My team consisted of a project manager and a second software engineer. I led the implementation of the project,
  building out the various screens, architecting the data model, designing the pages, and adding related functionality.
