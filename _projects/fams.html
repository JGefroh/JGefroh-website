<p>
  FAMS is an grant management system made for the State of Hawaii. It allowed the State to track incoming federal grants throughout their legislative and expenditure lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
Its centralized award repository allowed department heads and other users to track and immediately see the status of any award. It was built on top of a financial datamart, which allowed it to poll important data and gave it the capability to compare encumbered amounts to actual expenditures from accounts.
</p>
<p>
  As the tech lead of a team of 4, I defined development processes, prioritized incoming issues, mentored teammates, programmed modules, and designed the system.
</p>
<p>
  FAMS won distinction as a best-of-breed ERP replacement solution.
