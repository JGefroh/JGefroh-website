<p>
This was the very first version of my website. I had just gotten out of school and decided I needed an online presence to assist in finding a job.
</p>
<p>
  Some design criteria I had in mind for the initial website included the following:
  <ul>
    <li>A gallery for my projects</li>
    <li>Simple and minimal</li>
    <li>Rapid page loading times</li>
    <li>Compatible with many browsers and window sizes</li>
    <li>Minimal scrolling to view main content</li>
    <li>No Javascript</li>
  </ul>
  Looking back, I should have added "easy to maintain" as a criteria. I ran into severe maintenance problems since I had repeated markup everywhere. Lesson(s) learned.
