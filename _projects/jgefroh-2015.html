<p>
  This was my 2015 website overhaul.
</p>
<p>
  I overhauled my website because the process to update it took too long. In order to fix a typo, I had to start Jekyll, make the fix, rebuild the application, and then redeploy it. Adding new pages took even longer. Because it wasn't effortless to update the website, I didn't update as frequently.
</p>
<p>
  Using my new-found AngularJS skills, I took a day and rewrote my website. Once again, I had several criteria in mind:
  <ul>
    <li>Simple</li>
    <li>Easy to maintain</li>
    <li>A gallery for my projects</li>
    <li>A place to put my resume and skills</li>
    <li>Compatible with many browsers and window sizes</li>
    <li>Fun to work on</li>
    <li>SEO not required</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  This new website was much easier to maintain. The content that changes frequently is stored as JSON, which makes editing and redeploying incredibly easy.
</p>
