<p>
  My last website has only been up for a couple months at most, but here I am redoing it completely yet again.
</p>
<p>
  My last redo was packed with great information, but I felt the presentation of it was lacking. I got rid of the criss-cross design, and
  instead opted for a section-specific layout. The very beginning now featured a picture and intro of me prominently,
  and the projects section was a grid of screenshots of my top projects.
</p>
<p>
  I think it turned out well, but at this rate I'll probably redo it next week.
