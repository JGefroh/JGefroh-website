<p>
  The 2016 refresh of my website.
</p>
<p>
  I've never been a designer. I can't color coordinate worth anything, and variable letter spacing (kerning) in words doesn't bother me one bit. My 2015 website reflected that - it lacked personality or charm, and it felt very...sanitary. That's why I decided to redesign my website!
</p>
<p>
  I decided to go towards a 'Flat UI' design - it's been popular recently, and it also helps mask the fact that I have the graphics design ability of a potato. Simplicity, vibrancy, and crispness was the focus point in the aesthetics, and I also threw in a few other considerations:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Analytics (it's about time)
    </li>
    <li>
      Home page should feel less like a form and more like a flowing website
    </li>
  </ul>
  I like the way it turned out! It's actually a fairly drastic change from the content/text heavy 2015 design. We'll see what the 2017 redesign brings.</p>
