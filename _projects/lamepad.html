  A clone of Notepad.

  Lamepad was initially a weekend project that ended up taking only a couple of hours to do. It has font selection, styling, word-wrap, and even save and load functionality.

<p>
  The one disappointing thing that I didn't resolve was the fact that the font-selection performance was abysmal. There was a one second delay between picking a font and having it selected, causing the program to hang. This has something to do with how the fonts were formatted (using HTML). I would resolve this if I wanted to continue working on it, but I don't.
