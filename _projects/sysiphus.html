<p>A server monitoring tool I built to keep track of my many deployed applications and servers.</p>
<p>After some unnoticed downtime on one of my projects, I decided it was time to invest in learning about DevOps.
  I started with server monitoring with the assumption that the sooner I know about downtime, the faster I can fix it. I built Sysiphus, along with its various
deployable daemons and agents, and they now keep watch over my servers' uptimes.</p>
