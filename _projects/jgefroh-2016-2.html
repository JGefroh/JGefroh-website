<p>
  I ended up redoing my website sooner than I thought.
</p>
<p>
  I liked my 2016 website, but I really wanted to focus on making it even more sleek and aesthetically pleasing.
  My teammate had redesigned her website recently, and that inspired me to do another redesign.
</p>
<p>
  One major change I made was to ditch AngularJS and replace it with Jekyll. I had attempted to use Jekyll
  a couple years ago on my site, but removed it due to how long it took to change content. Now that I have
  more experience with how to structure the site to make it maintainable, and actually have a blog, Jekyll seemed
  like a perfect option for me.
</p>
<p>
  I think it turned out well.
