                "The Physician License Status Service (PLSS) is a team project I worked on as primary programmer/secondary project manager for a project management course. It was a part of the State of Hawaii's health transformation initiative, and intention was to create an API to facilitate the rapid transfer of information amongst physicians, insurers, and other interested third parties. It is effectively an API adapter that third parties can use to access a state database of license holders and do batch checks to see if licenses are in good standing or not.",
                "The PLSS API was intended to improve information exchange amongst care providers by decreasing the amount of time required before the status of a licensee could be verified. When a doctor requests patient information to provide care for a patient, he or she would not need to wait as long to receive this information because their license status could be verified by the holder of the information, and not through a chain of third parties and state agencies. ",
                "We developed the proof-of-concept and a fully functional prototype in Python 3, along with proper documentation and test cases. The API allowed for single and batch license searches using license IDs, names, and license ranges, and returned results in proper XML format. It worked fairly well but, due to a lack of database access, relied on the web interface of an existing website that actively prevented frequent requests using captchas.",
                "Additionally, we developed a huge amount of documentation in the course of project management, including charters, evaluation and status reports, plans, work breakdown structures, schedules, responsibility matrices, stakeholder and risk analysis, etc. ",

We met all of our milestones up until it was cancelled and had a final result that was functional and worked correctly. Further development could easily lead to it becoming a long-term solution for the State and stakeholders."

Development showed that Python's TCP sockets were unable to determine when a new message had arrived and what was part of the old message, thanks to TCP's non-guaranteed arrival order for packets. To resolve this, message sizes were added to the protocol. Other issues appeared, such as blocking sockets preventing new connections (resolved with threading and welcome sockets), console output overlapping input lines (resolved with back/forward ASCII codes), memory leaks (resolved with disconnect handlers), and concurrent modification of shared memory (resolved via synchronization, locks, and copies).
