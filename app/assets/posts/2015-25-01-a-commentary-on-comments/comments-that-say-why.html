<h3>Do Write Comments that Say Why</h3>
<p>Comments that help you get into the mindset of the developer are invaluable:</p>
<pre>
public Record getRecord(int id) {
    Record record = recordDAO.get(id);
    record.getChildren(); //[JG]: children are lazy loaded - this ensures record's children are loaded and returned
    return record;
}
</pre>

<p>If that comment was not present in the code, a developer may have removed the line thing it was a useless call with no effects.<p>

<br/>
<pre>
    public void startDownload(String fileToken) {
        frame.redirectTo(getDownloadUrl(fileToken));
        triggerDownloadEvents();
    }

    private void onDownloadFinished() {
        panel.remove(frame);
        panel.add(frame);   //[JG]: IE8 workaround: Frame is removed/added to clear history generated by download so it doesn't interfere with navigation.
    }
</pre>

<p>If that comment was not present in the code, it would look like a useless operation, and another developer could have introduced a navigation error.<p>
