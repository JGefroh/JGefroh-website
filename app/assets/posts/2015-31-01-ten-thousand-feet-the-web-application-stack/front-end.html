    <h3>Front-End</h3>
    <p>
    The front-end, or the user interface, is what the user interacts with when using the application.
    All of the buttons they click, the fields they type into, and the data they see is visible on the front-end.
    </p>
    <label>Types</label>
    <p>
        Two types of front-ends have emerged in the web application space: server side controlled and single page applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Server-side controlled front-ends are processed on the server first before being delivered to the user's web browser. Technologies like PHP and Java Server Pages are used
        to create what the user sees on the server prior to sending it to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Single Page Applications, on the other hand, do their processing on the user's computer instead, allowing for richer, real-time interactions that feel faster.
        Most of these applications use Javascript or Javascript related frameworks/libraries like JQuery and AngularJS to perform this processing.

    <label>Making Great Applications</label>
    <p>
        Figuring out how a page looks, what it shows, and examining the interactions the user can have with it are important to provide a usable, useful, valuable application for users.
        It's the job of the User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) expert to figure out how to make it easy for users to accomplish their goals in the application.
        This should not be taken lightly - if users cannot accomplish their goals, the application is a failure.
    </p>
    <label>A final note</label>
    <p>
        One important security consideration is that the front-end is not a trusted source. Data sent from the front-end should be verified by the server before being used.
