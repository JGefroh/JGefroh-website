    <h3>Web Services</h3>
    <p>
        The Web Service is the communication gateway into your server side. Your application's front-end will use the web service to perform actions and manipulate data.
    </p>

    <label>Types of Web Services</label>
    <p>There are two main types of Web Services: SOAP and REST.
    <p>
        SOAP is an older type of web service that uses a markup syntax called XML to define the way requests and responses are structured.
    </p>
    <p>
        REST is a newer type of web service that uses the HTTP protocol to perform requests and actions. Data sent to and from REST web services is typically in a format called JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use REST unless you have a very specific reason to use SOAP (such as supporting legacy software that already uses it).
    </p>

    <label>Web Services as a Service</label>
    <p>
        Web Services can be used by multiple applications communicate with a server, or with each other.
        They can be used to provide or consume services independent of other applications.
