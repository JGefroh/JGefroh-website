<p>It's easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission.</p>

<p>
  This is the cornerstone of good leadership. Leaders don't wait for the perfect opportunity to arise - they create it.
</p>
<p>
  If you see a problem, what do you do? Do you ignore it? Do you report it to someone else? Do you think of a possible solution,
  then ask whoever is in charge if you can apply it? Do you just go ahead and fix it?
</p>
<p>
  How you answer those questions depends not only on you, but also on the environment you operate in.
  Maybe you're in an environment that punishes taking the initiative and views such actions as insubordination. Perhaps you're in a high-risk environment where you're allowed to take the initiative, but you'll be punished severely if you fail.
</p>
<p>
  As a leader, I have to do my best to ensure that taking the initiative is promoted. To do this, I need to create
  an environment where, paradoxically, failure is an option. You can learn a lot from failure. If you punish failure, you
  effectively punish taking the initiative, which inherently has a level of risk associated with it. By punishing initiative,
  you effectively block innovation and learning. A company that doesn't innovate or learn is a company that is dying.

<p>
  Reward employees that show reasonable intiative, regardless of the outcome.
