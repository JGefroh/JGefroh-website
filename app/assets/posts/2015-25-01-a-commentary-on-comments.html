    <p>In software development, the extent to which comments are necessary is still debated.</p>

    <p>One side may argue that comments are incredibly critical to obtain software that works properly and is maintainable. On the other, comments are treated with disdain as the focus shifts to having self-documenting code. Who's right?</p>

    <p>
        The pragmatic answer to this debate would be “it depends.” The necessity and type of comments depends entirely on the quality of the code and the type of software being developed.

    <h4>When Comments are Required</h4>
    <p>Some types of software absolutely require comments. Developers would have an incredibly difficult time using a publicly released API without proper documentation, no matter how good the code is.
        However, <a data-ng-click="vm.showSection('documentation-is-hard')" style="cursor: pointer;">sometimes API documentation can go overboard</a>, and it's hard to find a right balance.
    </p>
    <p>Complicated algorithms and documentation of strange side-effects should absolutely be commented, but one could also argue that code requiring such comments should be rewritten.</p>

    <p>
        Pragmatically, I believe that comments exist to make the maintenence or usage of an application easier. Looking at the situation from this maintenance perspective,
        having  <a data-ng-click="vm.showSection('comments-that-say-why')" style="cursor: pointer;">comments that indicate WHY</a> a piece of code is doing something is infinitely more useful than <a data-ng-click="vm.showSection('comments-that-say-what')" style="cursor: pointer;">
        comments that say WHAT</a> code is doing.
