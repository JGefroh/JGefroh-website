  I’ve worked with Joseph for the last two years on a handful of projects, including enterprise financial record management software,
  community-driven event planning platforms, and personal projects intended just for learning.
</span><br/><br/>
<span>
Joseph has an <span class="highlight">undying curiosity</span> for anything development-related. This curiosity is paired with an unwavering commitment
to <span class="highlight">helping those around him learn</span> as well. Joseph spends countless hours of his own time researching, learning, and mentoring anyone who’s
interested. He constantly reads books and blogs on a wide range of topics, from application architecture to effective leadership to front-end
best practices.
</span><br/><br/>
<span>
Once Joseph learns something new, he’s eager to set aside time to share his findings, and he encourages others to do the same.
When Joseph and I worked together at eWorld, a few project teams (ours included) were beginning to use Angular. At the time, nobody
at the company was familiar with Angular, but Joseph spent an entire weekend learning everything he could about it. He came back on Monday with
a new personal project built in Angular and a better knowledge of the framework than everyone at the company combined. In case that wasn’t
<span class="highlight">awesome</span> enough, he took it a step further and set up a weekly meetup where quite a few coworkers and interns came by to learn about Angular
from him after work. This is a prime example of the type of thing that Joseph does that sets him <span class="highlight">leagues apart from other technical leads</span>.
</span><br/><br/>
<span>
Joseph is a strong proponent of constructive criticism and egoless programming. As both a leader and a developer, Joseph is always open to
suggestions for improvement. He’s <span class="highlight">easy to communicate with</span>, even when it comes to difficult or awkward topics. Joseph is always willing to
carve out time to discuss concerns, pinpoint where issues arise, and take proactive measures to ensure that the same problems don’t come up again.
When it comes to coding, Joseph is an <span class="highlight">egoless programmer</span>. He gladly welcomes any comments on his code or design, no matter how nitpicky,
because he’s <span class="highlight">dedicated to producing the best product</span> that he possibly can.
</span><br/><br/>
<span>
Joseph is the most dependable, honest, and selfless person I’ve ever met. When he says he’ll do something, he does it right away, and with a
smile. He’s quick to give credit where credit is due, and he never accepts full credit for his team’s accomplishments. He is an <span class="highlight">extraordinary
software developer, mentor, and leader</span>, and I would gladly sign up to be on one of his teams in the future.
</span><br/><br/>
<span>
Of all the technical leads I’ve worked under in the past, Joseph has been my favorite, by far. If you’re looking for an <span class="highlight">honest, ambitious, dependable team lead</span> with a <span class="highlight">great sense of humor</span>, you’ll find it in Joseph.
