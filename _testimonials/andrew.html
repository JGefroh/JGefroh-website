  It's rare that you find someone as <span class="highlight">dedicated to their craft</span> as Joseph is to quality software development.
  <br/><br/>

  In just the short amount of time that we worked together, <span class="highlight">Joseph had an enormous influence</span> on my growth as a software developer.
  <br/><br/>

  He is someone I consistently look to for advice and inspiration.
