            <p>
              I’ve worked with Joseph for the last two years on a handful of projects, including enterprise financial record management software, community-driven event planning platforms, and personal projects intended just for learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Joseph has an undying curiosity for anything development-related. This curiosity is paired with an unwavering commitment to helping those around him learn as well. Joseph spends countless hours of his own time researching, learning, and mentoring anyone who’s interested. He constantly reads books and blogs on a wide range of topics, from application architecture to effective leadership to front-end best practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once Joseph learns something new, he’s eager to set aside time to share his findings, and he encourages others to do the same. When Joseph and I worked together at eWorld, a few project teams (ours included) were beginning to use Angular. At the time, nobody at the company was familiar with Angular, but Joseph spent an entire weekend learning everything he could about it. He came back on Monday with a new personal project built in Angular and a better knowledge of the framework than everyone at the company combined. In case that wasn’t awesome enough, he took it a step further and set up a weekly meetup where quite a few coworkers and interns came by to learn about Angular from him after work. This is a prime example of the type of thing that Joseph does that sets him leagues apart from other technical leads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Joseph is a strong proponent of constructive criticism and egoless programming. As both a leader and a developer, Joseph is always open to suggestions for improvement. He’s easy to communicate with, even when it comes to difficult or awkward topics. Joseph is always willing to carve out time to discuss concerns, pinpoint where issues arise, and take proactive measures to ensure that the same problems don’t come up again. When it comes to coding, Joseph is an egoless programmer. He gladly welcomes any comments on his code or design, no matter how nitpicky, because he’s dedicated to producing the best product that he possibly can.
            </p>
            <p>
              Joseph is the most dependable, honest, and selfless person I’ve ever met. When he says he’ll do something, he does it right away, and with a smile. He’s quick to give credit where credit is due, and he never accepts full credit for his team’s accomplishments. He is an extraordinary software developer, mentor, and leader, and I would gladly sign up to be on one of his teams in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of all the technical leads I’ve worked under in the past, Joseph has been my favorite, by far. If you’re looking for an honest, ambitious, dependable team lead with a great sense of humor, you’ll find it in Joseph.

          <p>I have worked with many programmers, coders and developers in my career and it is my belief that Joseph Gefroh is one of the best I have met. He is methodical, he thinks through and plans his projects with care and detail that ensures that what he builds is scaleable, secure and easy to maintain.</p>
          <p>Yet he is more, besides being an excellent software engineer, he is extremely adept at managing a team of engineers. He understands how they think, how to motivate them and how to get the best work out of the team. His guidance and patience results in a content team of programmers who create solid code behind solid systems. We are lucky to have him guiding our development and I am grateful for the opportunity to work with and learn from him!</p>

            Joseph is an incredible software manager. He has an intuitive understanding of the balance between business and technological needs and he incorporates that knowledge into our teams at Snap! Raise both by example and instruction.
          </p>

          <p>
            He meets with most of the development team regularly in one-on-one sessions to ensure we're developing as engineers and learning the skills for success in everyday work as well as the skills that will help us achieve our longer term personal goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            His passion for adhering to foundational engineering principles is contagious and he's made our team excited about building products that we're proud of.

            I recommend Joseph for any position where he's in a position to inspire and lead an engineering team.

          <p>
            He is an engineer with passion and has a big picture view of the projects. I was very impressed by his quick and accurate actions on reviewing project code. He gives consideration to all kinds of factors and knows what the best solution will be.
          </p>

            At Snap! Raise I hired Joseph to take over my role as lead our Advance product. He made the most of the opportunity. He picked up on the technology fast and gained the respect of the team quickly as well. He is extremely well organized and has implemented very effective development practices and feature design practices. It is always nice to work with someone who is well versed in their skillset and open about making the team and business better. Sometimes that comes from challenging ideas that are not working well and at the same time making sure people are respected for their hard work.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all Joseph is a great technologist, mentor and team lead. I would recommend him for any position in any of those roles.
