            I showed my website to one of my friends and he told me that it "looked old." Ouch. 
            I showed it to another friend and she told me it was "Windows XP old." It was time for a website overhaul.
    </p>
    <p>While I didn't want to use Javascript in my initial website, in this version I use it heavily. 
    It seems that a vast majority of people have it enabled and my initial concerns about backwards compatibility were unfounded.</p>
    
    <p>One of the maintence problems I ran into with my old website was that in order to update the footer or header, I had to do it
    for every single page. I recently learned about a templating system called Jekyll which allowed me get around that. It also has some cool
    features like variable injection, which is nice.</p>
