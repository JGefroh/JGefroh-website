            I showed my original website to one of my friends, proud of the work I done. After a mere glance he told me that it "looked old." 
    
    What? That can't be! It must be a mistake! I quickly showed it to another friend, and she confirmed the bad news: my website was "Windows XP old." 
    It was time to bring my website to the modern age.
    </p>
    
    <h3>The Overhaul</h3>
    <p>I sat down and thought to myself what requirements I had for the website overhaul. While some of the requirements were the same from my previous website, others had changed. The "No Javascript"
    philosophy was out - most people had Javascript enabled, and I figured it was time to join the club. I wanted to add a place for my resume and wanted a site that was easily updated. </p>
    In the end I came up with the following list of requirements: 
    <ul>
         <li>A gallery for my projects</li>
         <li>A modern appearance</li>
         <li>A place to put my resume and skills</li>
         <li>Easily updated with content</li>
         <li>Simple and minimal</li>
         <li>Rapid page loading times</li>
         <li>Compatible with many browsers and window sizes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A modern appearance was easy enough. Everyone was using Bootstrap, so I figured I should learn how to use it as well.</p>
    <p>The difficult part would have been the "easily updated" requirement. Footers and navigation bars appear on every page, and would have had to be changed manually.
    
    <br />Luckily, I had recently learned about a templating technology called Jekyll, which allowed me to split my website into multiple parts and combine them in layouts with a compiler.
    As a result, I only had to write my navigation bar and footer once. Even the slideshows and the link bar of this project page are merely components that were combined by Jekyll. 
    
    <br />
    <br />DRY at its finest!
